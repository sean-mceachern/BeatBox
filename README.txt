Music Maker:

This exercise is from Ch 13 of head start Java

In this exercise I built a GUI which allows the user to select from 16 different instrument sounds over 16 measures and combines them all in an audio track and plays the track.

MiniMusicPlayer: plays some tones using a for loop. two tracks read in from the MIDI library

BeatBox: Displays a GUI with 16 instruments loaded in from the MIDI library. Displays 16 tick boxes for each instrument which will allow the user to select the instruments for each of the 16 beat measures. The user can start, stop, increase tempo, or decrease tempo using the buttons which were implemented with ActionListener class.
